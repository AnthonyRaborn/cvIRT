\usage{
simpleBootstrap(responseData, modelTypes, bootSize = 50,
  replications = 1, leaveOneOut = F, indicator = TRUE, ...,
  seed = NULL, type = "person")
}
\arguments{
\item{responseData}{The initial, full sample data as a matrix of item responses.}

\item{modelTypes}{A character vector specifying the model types to be compared. Uses the `TAM` package format, so must be one of the following: "1PL", "2PL", "PCM", "PCM2", "RSM", "GPCM", and "2PL.groups".}

\item{bootSize}{An integer value greater than 0 that indicates the number of bootstrap samples to draw.}

\item{replications}{The number of replications of the bootstrap procedure to perform. Not suggested to use as for the standard bootstrap changing the `bootSize` is more efficient.}

\item{leaveOneOut}{A logical value indicating whether to use `leaveOneOut` bootstrap. Not suggested for use.}

\item{indicator}{A logical value that controls the progress printing.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to the `tam` function.}

\item{seed}{Either a positive integer setting the random seed, or `NULL`.}

\item{type}{A character vector specifying whether the validation treats the "person" or the "item" as the unit of observation. Default is "person".}
}
\value{
A list object of class "cvIRT" with the following values:
\item{call}{The original function calls.}
\item{seed}{The random seed that produced the results.}
\item{bootstrapSamples}{A list of each bootstrap samples' training data.}
\item{testLik}{A matrix of the loglikelihood values estimated on the testing data for each model within each holdout replication.}
\item{nModelParams}{A matrix of the number model parameters estimated on the training data within each holdout replication.}
\item{AIC}{A matrix of the AIC value for each holdout replication, as well as the mean value across each replication.}
\item{AICc}{A matrix of the AICc value for each holdout replication, as well as the mean value across each replication.}
\item{BIC}{A matrix of the BIC value for each holdout replication, as well as the mean value across each replication.}
\item{-2 log-Likelihood Ratio Test}{A list of the log-likelihood ratio test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p-values for each model comparison and each replication, as well as the test using the mean test statistics and degrees of freedom. If only one model is used, returns `NULL`.}
\item{warnings}{A character vector of any warnings incurred while the method runs.}
\item{time}{A vector of the start and end times of the function.}
